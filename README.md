# Self Driving Car ðŸš— App

Welcome to the Self Driving Car App! This app is a simulation of a self driving car using artificial intelligence (AI), neural networks, and machine learning.

## Tech Stack

This app was built using the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Features

- Simulation of a self driving car navigating a virtual roadway
- Utilization of AI, neural networks, and machine learning to make driving decisions

## Installation

## About AI

AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as learning and problem solving. In this app, we are using AI to make driving decisions for the self driving car.

## About Neural Networks

A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. It is composed of layers of interconnected "neurons," which process and transmit information. In this app, we are using a neural network to process data and make driving decisions for the self driving car.

## About Machine Learning

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms on data to allow them to make decisions or predictions. In this app, we are using machine learning to train the driving algorithm for the self driving car.
